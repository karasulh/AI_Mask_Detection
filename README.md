Mask Detection with Three Labels: Correct / Incorrect / No Mask

This project is a deep learning project based on Pyhton OpenCV. The aim of this project is detecting mask status of a people and labeling them. Different from similar projects, there are three labels which are "Correct Mask / Incorrect / No Mask" 

Two pyhton files are existed. "train_mask_detector" is used to train a model. "detect_mask_video" is used to run this model and detect mask in real time.
Your libraries should be suitable with in "requirements.txt" versions.
